<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Okay so basically, this project comes from a very basic simple and that's just to make my life easier.
My graphics card is more performant when I'm playing in 1920x1080, but I prefer working on 2560x1440. So each time I wanted to play a game, I needed to change the resolution each time.
It's tiring after a while. So I simply made a program to dynamically change the resolution when it detects a specific program.
